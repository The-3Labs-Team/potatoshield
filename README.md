## Before you start

Before you start using potatoshield, you need to know that it is not a 100% bulletproof solution. Adblockers are constantly evolving, and they may find a way to detect potatoshield in the future.

The best way to fight against adblock users is to clone the project, build the script, and host it on your server (jump to #https://github.com/The-3Labs-Team/potatoshield#make-it-undetectable). This way, you can rotate the script name and make it harder for adblockers to detect it.

## Installation

You have three methods to use potatoshield on your website:

### 1. Inline the script (recommended)

You can inline the script in your HTML layout before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script type="module" defer>
  // Add your potatoshield obfuscated code here
</script>
```

### 2. Import the script (partially recommended) // Not yet implemented

You can install potatoshield by using NPM:

```bash
npm install potatoshield
```

Then, you can import it in one of your main JavaScript file:

```javascript
import 'potatoshield';
```

You can use the obfuscated code generated by the build script to inline the script in your layout.

### 3. Download the script (not recommended)

You can download the script from releases at the root of your website, rename it to something less suspicious and import it in your layout:

```html
<script type="module" defer src="your-potato-random-file.js"></script>
```

This can be easily detected by adblocker lists, so it is not recommended.

> üí° Why not using CDN? Because adblockers can easily block the CDN URL. You can host the file on your own server and randomize the name to avoid detection. Remember to rotate the file name every week or so, or Adblock users (and lists) will be able to block it.

### 4. Use the CDN (not recommended)

You can use the CDN to import the script in your layout:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/The-3Labs-Team/potatoshield@main/dist/potatoshield.min.ob.js"></script>
```

This can be easily detected by adblocker lists, so it is not recommended.

## Make it undetectable

To make potatoshield undetectable by adblockers, you can use the following tips:

- **Rotate the script name**: Change the name of the script file every week or so. This will make it harder for adblockers to detect it.

- **Obfuscate the code**: You can obfuscate the code of the script to make it harder to read and detect.

You can clone the repository and build the script with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a minified and obfuscated version of the script in the `dist` folder called `potatoshield.min.ob.js`.

It is important to remember that potatoshield is not a 100% bulletproof solution. It is a tool to help you fight against adblock users, but it is not a guarantee that it will work forever. Adblockers are constantly evolving, and they may find a way to detect potatoshield in the future.
