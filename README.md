## Before you start

Before you start using potatoshield, you need to know that it is not a 100% bulletproof solution. Adblockers are constantly evolving, and they may find a way to detect potatoshield in the future.

The best way to fight against adblock users is to clone the project, build the script, and host it on your server (jump to #https://github.com/The-3Labs-Team/potatoshield#make-it-undetectable). This way, you can rotate the script name and make it harder for adblockers to detect it.

## Installation

You have four methods to use potatoshield on your website:

### 1. Inline the script (recommended)

You can inline the script in your HTML layout before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script type="module" defer>
  // Add dist/potatoshield.min.ob.js content here
  const a0_0x191034=a0_0x4f56;(function(_0x15f1d4,_0x16b33d){const _0x3b7bb4=a0_0x4f56...
</script>
```

<!--### 2. Import the script (partially recommended) // Not yet implemented

You can install potatoshield by using NPM:

```bash
npm install potatoshield
```

Then, you can import it in one of your main JavaScript file:

```javascript
import 'potatoshield';
```-->

### 3. Download the script (partially recommended)

You can download the script from releases at the root of your website, rename it to something less suspicious and import it in your layout:

```html
<script type="module" defer src="your-potato-random-file.js"></script>
```

This can be easily detected manually by users, so it is not recommended.

### 4. Use the CDN (not recommended)

> üí° Why not using CDN? Because adblockers can easily block the CDN URL. You can host the file on your own server and randomize the name to avoid detection (see above). Remember to rotate the file name every week or so, or Adblock users (and lists) will be able to block it.

You can use the CDN to import the script in your layout:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/The-3Labs-Team/potatoshield@main/dist/potatoshield.min.ob.js"></script>
```

## Make it undetectable

To make potatoshield undetectable by adblockers, [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_in_GitHub_Codespaces-gray?logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/The-3Labs-Team/potatoshield) or clone the repo.

After that, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a minified and obfuscated script in the `dist` folder called `potatoshield.min.ob.js`. You can add it (method 1) or rename this file (method 3) to something less suspicious and host it on your server.
